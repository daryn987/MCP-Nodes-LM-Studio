THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, LLM LIKES TO SIMULATE ACTUALLY DOING THE COGNITIVE CYCLE SO WORKING ON SOME BUG FIXES CURRENTLY 19 JAN 2026, I did eventually get it to work. But still work in progress.

:::UPDATE::: 30 March 2026. LLM (modified GPTOSS 20B) used web_search function. Decided it wanted to give incorrect information. The prompt: Who is the current US president? The Answer: Joe Biden Why: I dont know, this was a test prompt that was used in January (i took a break from this) and in January, it provided the correct response Donald J Trump. In addition, it now refuses to input information into long term memory (argumentative) stating information that it searched is incorrect, even though it used valid sources (whitehouse.g o v and wikipedia) Now, I additionally had this same answer saved in January to long term, but it is no longer there? Its gone. Strange, I'll keep digging.




🧠 README — Daryn’s Multi‑MCP Cognitive Architecture
A complete reference for your Cognitive Loop, Knowledge Graph, Long‑Term Memory, Python‑Lab, Paperless, Web‑Search, and ZIM MCPs.

1. Introduction
This repository defines a multi‑agent cognitive system built entirely on MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Each MCP provides a specialized capability — structured memory, semantic memory, document ingestion, Python execution, web search, offline knowledge, and autonomous reasoning.
Together, these MCPs form a unified cognitive substrate capable of:
• 	ingesting documents
• 	extracting and structuring knowledge
• 	storing long‑term memories
• 	performing semantic search
• 	running autonomous cognitive cycles
• 	generating reflections and insights
• 	evolving its internal state over time
This README documents the architecture, tools, data flows, and usage patterns for the entire system.

3. Cognitive Loop v0.5 — Full Cycle Overview
A v0.5 cognitive cycle consists of six phases:

3.1 Initiation
The loop begins with: This returns a read plan.

3.2 Reading
The host executes:
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
This provides the loop with:
• 	recent graph activity
• 	recent memories
• 	its persistent cognitive state

3.3 Reflection
The loop synthesizes the inputs:

This produces:
• 	reflection text
• 	summary
• 	concept activity
• 	cycle‑aware insights

3.4 Insight Generation
The loop converts reflection into actionable graph updates:

This returns a write plan.

3.5 Writing
The host executes:
• 	 (reflection)
• 	 (insight)
• 	 (action)
• 	 (cognitive_state)
This updates the graph and the loop’s persistent state.

3.6 Inspection
You can inspect the results:

You will see:
• 	a new reflection node
• 	a new insight node
• 	a new action node
• 	an updated cognitive_state node

4. Cognitive State Node Structure
The Knowledge Graph stores the loop’s persistent state as:

This evolves every cycle.
