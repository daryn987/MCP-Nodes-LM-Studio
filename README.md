🧠 README — Daryn’s Multi‑MCP Cognitive Architecture
A complete reference for your Cognitive Loop, Knowledge Graph, Long‑Term Memory, Python‑Lab, Paperless, Web‑Search, and ZIM MCPs.

1. Introduction
This repository defines a multi‑agent cognitive system built entirely on MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Each MCP provides a specialized capability — structured memory, semantic memory, document ingestion, Python execution, web search, offline knowledge, and autonomous reasoning.
Together, these MCPs form a unified cognitive substrate capable of:
• 	ingesting documents
• 	extracting and structuring knowledge
• 	storing long‑term memories
• 	performing semantic search
• 	running autonomous cognitive cycles
• 	generating reflections and insights
• 	evolving its internal state over time
This README documents the architecture, tools, data flows, and usage patterns for the entire system.

2. System Architecture
Your system is composed of several cooperating MCP servers. Each one exposes tools through LM Studio, and the Cognitive Loop orchestrates them into a coherent reasoning engine.

3. Cognitive Loop v0.5 — Full Cycle Overview
A v0.5 cognitive cycle consists of six phases:

3.1 Initiation
The loop begins with: This returns a read plan.

3.2 Reading
The host executes:
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
This provides the loop with:
• 	recent graph activity
• 	recent memories
• 	its persistent cognitive state

3.3 Reflection
The loop synthesizes the inputs:

This produces:
• 	reflection text
• 	summary
• 	concept activity
• 	cycle‑aware insights

3.4 Insight Generation
The loop converts reflection into actionable graph updates:

This returns a write plan.

3.5 Writing
The host executes:
• 	 (reflection)
• 	 (insight)
• 	 (action)
• 	 (cognitive_state)
This updates the graph and the loop’s persistent state.

3.6 Inspection
You can inspect the results:

You will see:
• 	a new reflection node
• 	a new insight node
• 	a new action node
• 	an updated cognitive_state node

4. Cognitive State Node Structure
The Knowledge Graph stores the loop’s persistent state as:

This evolves every cycle.
